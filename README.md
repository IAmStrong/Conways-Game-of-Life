# Conway's Game of Life

The scene of the game or the <strong>"universe"</strong> - is a space, divided into <strong>cells</strong>. Each cell has either one of two states: it could be <strong>alive</strong> or it could be <strong>dead</strong>. The cell has eight <strong>neighbors</strong>. Every next <strong>generation</strong> is formed upon the basis of the preceding one following the strict <strong>rules</strong>:

* any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

As a participant of the Web Development Championship (standard category) <strong>my task was the following</strong>:

1) Recreate the algorithm using JavaScript
2) Graphical implementation of the "universe". The scene of the game is 200x200 cells;
3) The ability to fill the "universe" with a random set of alive cells;
4) Game's controls: stop, pause, restart;
5) The ability to control game's speed;
5) Draw mode: the ability to add/remove cells to/from the "universe" by hand;

<strong>My work was appreciated by the Judges, therefore I got to the semi-final of the Championship.</strong>
